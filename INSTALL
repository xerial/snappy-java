[Installation note of snappy-java]

If your OS platform is one of the Windows/Linux/Mac OS X (32/64 bit Intel CPUs), the installation process described here is unnecessary. Simply put snappy-java-(version).jar to your Java classpath. If your OS is not listed above, create your own snappy-java-(version).jar file as follows. 


= Required tools for building snappy-java =

[For all platforms]

* Java 6 (JDK1.6) http://java.sun.com/
 - set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the Java installation folder (e.g. JAVA_HOME=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_24 in Windows)
* Maven 3.x http://maven.apache.org/
 - Check mvn command can be used from your command line.

[Windows (32/64-bit)]
* GNU make 
* And also tar, curl, cp, rm, grep commands are needed. (I use Cygwin and MinGW for building snappy-java in Windows)

[Windows (32-bit only)]
* Install MinGW http://www.mingw.org/
* Set PATH to the following command in MinGW package
 - mingw32-g++
 - strip

To build x86 (32bit) dll under 64-bit Windows, use "make win32" target.

[Windows (64-bit only)]
* Download MinGW-w64 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ 
* Set PATH to the following commands in the downloaded archive: 
 - x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
 - x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip

NOTICE: Do not use the Cygwin version of MinGW-w64. It fails to build assemblies for 64bit environment.

[Linux (32/64-bit)]
* gcc-4.5.x or higher is necessary because snappy-java uses -static-libstdc++ option. It is possible to use gcc-4.3.x but a dependency to libstdc++ remains in the generated jar file; That means if another version of libstdc++ is used, snappy-java might not work correctly.
* You can build 32-bit native library with 64-bit Linux machine (do make linux32)

[Mac]
* Install gcc, make, etc. included in Mac OS X install disk. (X Code)
* Install mercurial using Mac Ports http://www.macports.org/

= Building snappy-java =

To build jar file of snappy-java, type:
$ make 

A native library for your machine environment and a jar package target/snappy-java-(version).jar are produced in the target folder.

= Building only the native library = 
$ make native

= Rebuild the native library for your platform =
$ make clean-native native


= Using system installed libsnappyjava (or snappyjava.dll) = 

Set org.xerial.snappy.use.systemlib system property to true:

java -Djava.library.path=(path to the installed snappyjava lib) -Dorg.xerial.snappy.use.systemlib=true  ...

With this setting snappy-java does not use bundled native libraries. Insted it tries to load native library installed at the path specified in java.library.path.


= Configure snappy-java using property file =

Prepare org-xerial-snappy.properties file (under the root path of your library) in Java's property file format.
Here is a list of the available properties:

 * org.xerial.snappy.lib.path   (directory containing a snappyjava's native library)
 * org.xerial.snappy.lib.name   (library file name)
 * org.xerial.snappy.tempdir    (temporary directory to extract a native library bundled in snappy-java)
 * org.xerial.snappy.use.systemlib  (if this value is true, use system installed libsnappyjava.so looking the path specified by java.library.path)
